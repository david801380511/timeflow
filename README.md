## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timeflow.git
   cd timeflow
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r config/requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**

   The database will be automatically created when you first run the application. If you need to manually initialize it:
   ```bash
   python -c "from backend.database import init_db; init_db()"
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

   The server will start on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

6. **Access the application**

   Open your browser and navigate to:
   - Main app: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - API docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "python-multipart" error**
If you see an error about python-multipart being required:
```bash
pip install python-multipart
```

**Issue: Database errors**
If you encounter database errors, try deleting `timeflow.db` and restarting the application to create a fresh database.
